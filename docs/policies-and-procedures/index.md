# Policies and Procedures

We need to document the minimal set of governance information so that users know where to access support, post questions, help with documentation and so forth.

**CLOG QUESTIONS** - I have a question about CLOG, where can I ask?

**CLOG BUG REPORTING** - I found a bug in CLOG, where do I submit it?

**DOCUMENTATION QUESTION** - I have a question about the documentation project, where is the official discussion hosted?

**DOCUMENTATION BUG REPORT** - I found a bug in the documentation, where do I report it?
